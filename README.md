##NBA Professional Network Analysis
An investigation into coaching and mentorship (in the NBA).


###Motivation
With my keen interest in basketball, I pursued an analysis of professional relationships, particularly those between NBA players and coaches. Players are constantly scrutinized for their game performances and multi-million dollar contracts; however, coaches are also paid handsomely. Most recently in the summer of 2014, two coaches with no prior coaching experience were awarded with identical contracts of $25M over 5 years. That's a lot of money. In someone's estimation, these coaches are worth $5M annually to develop professional basketball players.
 
Common thought suggests that coaches/mentors are indeed valuable for development. Having the right mentor at the right time is, well, invaluable. But their true impact is often ambiguous, as there are so many aspects of mentorship to consider. 

My ultimate goal for this analysis is to identify signals that can explain the impact/value of an NBA coach.
